  Methodological information 
The data was sampled in 2005 from the Harvard Forest in Massachusetts. Local ecologists collected data on two plants of each Sarracenia species. Each plant was assigned to one of six feeding levels in a regression design ranging from 0 - 0.25g of finely ground wasps per feeding (for small species), 0 - 0.5g (for species of intermediate sizes), and 0 - 1.0g (for large species) and fed once a week for seven weeks. There were 120 plants total and aboveground size and mass were measured before and after treatment (Ellison et al. 2017).
